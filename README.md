## やっほー 👋🏻
<p align="justify">I'm Suki Tsubaki. 🌸 I'm not a professional developer, but I have a grasp of coding and enjoy it as a hobby since my childhood. I work on small side projects from time to time, constantly learning and exploring something new. Most of my larger repositories are very specific and private, but I enjoy revisiting and expanding, finding new ways to solve and improve it.</p>

<p align="justify">I have advanced skills in HTML, CSS, PHP, Python and TypoScript, as well as beginner skills in Lua, JavaScript and SQL. In addition to coding, I plan to set up and train my own AI/ML model on my Raspberry Pi in the future, to explore the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>
